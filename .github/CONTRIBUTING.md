# BlockJS Contributing Guide

## Issues

### Creating issues

If you spot a bug or have a feature recommendation, please first make sure that there is not already an
issue open. If you find that there isn't, you can create one.

### Solving issues

Feel free to search through our [open issues](https://github.com/Block-JS/blockjs/issues) and see if there is an
issue that you may want to solve. We don't usually assign issues to any single person, if you find one you want
to contribute to, you are welcome to open a [pull request](#pull-requests).

## Making Changes

### Contributing to the code

To contribute to the core code of BlockJS, you should first start by forking the repo and cloning the repo to your
local machine.

From there you can make any changes you need to and commit them (you can make multiple commits if you prefer, we'll
let GitHub squash your commits before merging).

After you've made all your changes and you've commited them, you can [open a pull request](#pull-requests) to have
your changes merged.
